- added: setting: restoreScrollPosition
    - when this setting is off, the scroll position will not be set by the plugin

this version adds **mobile support**.
you may need to adjust the plugin's delay settings on your mobile device to optimise performance.

- mobile-only features
    - switch to edit mode
        - when opening a note, the plugin will optionally open the editor (instead of the viewer), and bring the cursor to the last edited line.
        - this version utilises recent upgrades made to the Joplin plugin API in v3.2.
    - you will find the `Go to home note` command on the editor toolbar.
- supported features
    - save cursor and selection.
    - home note / last active note on startup.
    - you may sync the cursor between the mobile and desktop apps by enabling `Sync data using note properties (Experimental)`, but beware of sync conflicts!
- unsupported features
    - saved scroll position.
    - opening the last active note in a notebook, as the plugin API does not have an event listener for folder selection.
